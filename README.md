This repository contains solutions to the Node.js assessment tasks. Each task is solved in a separate JavaScript file. Below are the descriptions of the tasks and links to the solutions.

## Task Descriptions

### Task 1: Basic Node.js Server

**Objective:** Create a simple Node.js server that listens on port 3000 and responds with "Hello, World!" for all incoming HTTP requests.

- **Solution:** [task1.js](https://github.com/JigXi-13/onePocketNodeAssessment/blob/main/task1.js)

### Task 2: Data Manipulation

**Objective:** Write a function in Node.js that takes an array of integers as input and returns the sum of all the numbers.

- **Solution:** [task2.js](https://github.com/JigXi-13/onePocketNodeAssessment/blob/main/task2.js)

### Task 3: Asynchronous File Handling

**Objective:** Create a Node.js script that reads a text file named "data.txt" and counts the number of words in it. The script should print the total word count to the console.

- **Solution:** [task3.js](https://github.com/JigXi-13/onePocketNodeAssessment/blob/main/task3.js)

## Running the Solutions

To run the solutions, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, navigate to the directory containing the solution file in your terminal and run the command `node filename.js`, replacing `filename.js` with the name of the file you wish to run.

For example, to run the solution for Task 1, use:

```bash
node task1.js
